# Deep-Learning-Project-Group-10
Deep Learning project for TU Delft's course CS4180 Deep Learning


## Plan

### Reproduce convolutional network
* Implement the CNN.
* Run on CASIA dataset.
* Compare performance.

### Run the model on the "difficult" dataset(s)
* Check the performance of the implemented CNN on the "difficult" [dataset](http://www.diid.unipa.it/cvip/?page_id=48#CMFD).
* If we have enough time, we can check the performance of the implemented CNN in another "difficult" [dataset](http://ifc.recod.ic.unicamp.br/fc.website/index.py?sec=5).


### Improve/Fix performance
* Perform tetsts with regularization, layers, hyperparameters etc.
