# Image-Forgery-Detection-CNN :mortar_board:

In this project we used [pytorch](https://pytorch.org/) in order to implement a convolutional neural network (CNN) for the purpose of extracting features in the problem of forgery detetion. This approach is inspired by the work of Y. Rao et al. [A Deep Learning Approach to Detection of Splicing and Copy-Move Forgeries in Images](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7823911). Then after the feature fusion, proposed in the same paper, we take the extracted features and give them as input to an SVM that does the final binary classification task. The SVM implementation was taken from [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/). This project was done for the final project of TU Delft's course CS4180 Deep Learning 2019 by Group 10.
